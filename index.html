                    <!-- <li><p>Positive association helps! Give your cat a little treat before and after each photo shoot. My cat Toki Nantucket (CatAtelier's model) gets paid in chicken for his modeling services. I keep cooked chicken, cut into bites, in ziplock bags in the refrigerator (and stored in the freezer) which he gets as treats. He loves chicken! After each photo shoot he will run to the refrigerator because he knows he gets some chicken.Prepare the area that the photos will be taken in advance. It's best to select a small room with good lighting. If necessary, bring in more lights. If you want background or props, that should also be prepared in advance. You can pin up a sheet or fabric, or drape it over something. Avoid colors that will blend into the clothing or your cat's fur. Also avoid colors that contrast too much with the fur/ clothing colors, such as black background for white cats/ clothes, because the details will be hard to see. Medium tones like grey work nicely, but stronger colors like red can also look great.Don't forget to make the area clean and comfortable for your cat to sit or stand in. </p></li> -->

                    <!-- <li><p>Corners are good for photo shoots because your cat can turn in two directions, and you can move to photograph them depending on which way they are facing. When you have everything prepared, including the camera, lights, area, attention-grabber, and the cat's outfit, give your cat a treat and bring them into the area. Dress them quickly, arrange the clothing to suit you. It's good to take a lot of photos quickly- you can go through them later. Pause occasionally to check that the clothing has not shifted. Shake whatever you are using to grab their attention, or have a friend behind you do it. Act like it's exciting!Remember to be as still as possible when you snap the pictures. Don't worry about getting it perfectly in frame because you can crop the photos later on the computer. Please keep photo shoots short! Keep in mind that sometimes it is just not happening that day- your cat is not in the mood to comply. He or she is a cat, after all. Give up immediately and give your cat the after-treat anyway! Try the photo shoot some other day. Good luck! and have FUN!</p></li> -->
